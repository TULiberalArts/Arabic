## Arabic minor:

The minor in Arabic focuses on intermediate and advanced language skills and an understanding of contemporary Arabic culture. Students who already have a grounding in Arabic and are interested in languages, literature, film, and culture will find this minor of particular interest. This program is ideal for students considering careers in international business, government service, or other professions where foreign language proficiency is important. Students who place out of one or more of the Arabic language courses may replace those requirements with independent study or electives as approved by the Arabic faculty advisor. Electives must focus exclusively on Arab literature, film, history, or culture.
