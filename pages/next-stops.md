## Thinking of Transferring?
Almost half of incoming Temple students transfer from other colleges and universities. If you’ve taken 15 or more college-level credits after high school graduation, you can apply for admission as a transfer student. If you’re thinking about transferring, consider attending a [Transfer Tuesday](http://admissions.temple.edu/visit/transfer-tuesday) general information session.
